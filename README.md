GoJoust
===========
A slow burn project to make a fairly authentic replica of arcade Joust.

Once it's complete enough I'd like to add a scrolling mode. I'm curious what these old "wrap around" games like the original Mario Bros and Joust play like with horizontal scrolling. It must make it easier and less frustrating, being able to use the whole playfield without worrying about an enemy lurking around the corner, but does it ruin the gameplay? I'm curious to find out.


Controls are left, right and space to flap.
